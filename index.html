    <p> Facebook is helpful for those who are not able to communicate verbally. 
        This is a great way for the deaf or dumb to meet new people as well as meet people 
        with their disabilities. In addition, the writer did not consider it easier for those who 
        spare their time to convey with others without being near them. So, this is the reason 
        that why social media is advantageous.
        Next, it states that this application of social networking promotes poor communication 
        and friendship skills because Facebook has become universal which allows to 
        everybody to contact or make friendships with another people in the whole world. This 
        breaks down the communication barriers that can only be done with a universal 
        network like this and permits to connect with others if you were traveling. The novelist 
        does not consider that it can reunite you with your old friends that you may have lost 
        touch with.</p>
